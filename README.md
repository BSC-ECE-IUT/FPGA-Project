impress.js may not help you if you have nothing interesting to say ;)


HOW TO USE IT
---------------

[Use the source](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/blob/master/index.html), Luke ;)

If you have no idea what I mean by that, or you just clicked that link above and got 
very confused by all these strange characters that got displayed on your screen,
it's a sign, that impress.js is not for you.

Sorry.

Fortunately there are some guys on GitHub that got quite excited with the idea of building
editing tool for impress.js. Let's hope they will manage to do it.
